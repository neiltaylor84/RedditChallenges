Challenge #214 : 

For today's challenge, you will get a list of numbers as input which will serve as your statistical population, and you are then going to calculate the standard deviation of that population. There are statistical packages for many programming languages that can do this for you, but you are highly encouraged not to use them: the spirit of today's challenge is to implement the standard deviation function yourself.
